# Gmail_PDF_Grabber
This is a Python script that I created to help automate my dad's hobby of selling DVDs on eBay. He sends me shipping labels as PDFs and I needed a way to quickly and easily download and print these labels. I am currently working on automating the printing process so that I can simply run the script and have the labels downloaded and printed on my thermal printer. I am still trying to figure out how to only print labels that were uploaded on the current day, so as not to print any old labels. I was able to accomplish this by using the IMAP protocol to download unread emails that include the PDFs. I am still working on getting the automatic printing feature to work but this script is a great start to streamlining my dad's ebay business.
